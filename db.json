Orders are issued for an army to be assembled to join him a little later. Pope John VIII receives Charles at Vercelli. But at the same time Carloman, king of Bavaria and the East Mark, has also crossed the Alps into eastern Lombardy at the head of a powerful army. Charles hurries on the coronation of Richilda as Empress and sends her back to Gaul with orders for the reinforcements to hurry. However, the Frankish aristocracy is more concerned with the attacks by the Northmen in their country than the war with the Saracens in southern Italy. When the reinforcements do not arrive, Charles the Bald is compelled to return to West Francia. But on the road he dies in a poor hovel. It is said that he was poisoned by his Jewish doctor Zedekiah. Carloman of Bavaria, forced by an epidemic which broke out in his army, returns to Germany. When Louis the Stammerer receives news of the death of his father, Charles the Bald, he makes plans to go into West Francia to receive the oath of fidelity from his new subjects. On his way he learns that the magnates are refusing him obedience by rallying around Boso and the Abbot Hugh. The rebels are supported by his stepmother, the widowed Empress Richilda, and, as a sign of their displeasure, ravage the country. Boso is the brother of Richilda and duke of Provence. Hugh had been given the Abbey of Saint-Bertin by Louis\u2019 father. Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims, intercedes and the rebels agree to a settlement.

Conrad of Montferrat, who has negotiated the surrender, raises the banners of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and of the Third Crusade leaders Richard I of England, Philip II of France, and Leopold V of Austria on the city's walls and towers.  Richard stays to push on to Jerusalem, but Philip returns to France to take possession of a part of Flanders whose count had died at the siege of Acre.  Back in France, Philip also schemes with Richard's brother, John of England, to dispossess Richard of his French lands while he is still away, but the intervention of John's (and Richard's) mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, foils the plan.''King John'' by Warren.

The consumption of beef and veal is prohibited, and Pope Paul V issues an edict prohibiting the slaughter of draught oxen that were suitable for plowing.
